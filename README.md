# Simple Chat with GUI

This is a simple chat application with a graphical user interface (GUI). It allows users to communicate with each other in a chatroom-like environment. The program consists of a server-side component and a client-side component.

## Getting Started

To start the program, follow the steps below:

1. Start the server-side component by opening the following file:
   `Simple-Chat-with-GUI/Backend/ServerSide/ServerSide/ServerSide/bin/Debug/ServerSide.exe`

   This will launch the server and make it ready to accept client connections.

2. Next, start the client-side component by opening the following file:
   `Simple-Chat-with-GUI/Backend/ClientSide/ClientSide/ClientSide/bin/Debug/ClientSide.exe`

   This will launch the client application and allow you to connect to the server.
